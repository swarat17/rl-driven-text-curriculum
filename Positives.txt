1. Meta-learning (learning to learn)

2. Curriculum learning (intelligent data sequencing)

3. Reinforcement learning (training a teacher to guide the student)

4. NLP and transfer learning (with BERT embeddings)

5. Curriculum is a stepping stone to:

Adaptive sampling (based on feedback)

Multi-task learning (easy → hard tasks)

Continual learning (new tasks without forgetting)

6. “Even though final accuracy is comparable, curriculum learning offers faster convergence, interpretability, and a reusable structure for scaling to harder or evolving tasks. Our RL-based difficulty estimation builds a foundation for intelligent training beyond fixed epochs or static datasets — and that’s the real long-term value.”

7. "Curriculum Resists Overfitting at Scale"

8. “Our RL-based curriculum learning framework achieves comparable or better generalization to standard training, while reducing training time by 50% and mitigating overfitting. By learning a difficulty-based sample schedule using PPO and enforcing structured training dynamics, we make learning more efficient and interpretable — with no human-defined curriculum.”

-------------------------------------------------
❌ Arguments against continuing:
The performance gap over random curriculum is marginal (often <0.3%).

You’ve had to set up PPO training, difficulty score extraction, regressor fitting, and bucketing — a lot of engineering overhead.

Reviewers or professors may ask: “Why not just do stratified or confidence-based sampling?”

You haven't yet shown a clear generalization win over simpler curriculum or even vanilla.

✅ Arguments for showcasing this:
Your pipeline is real and demonstrates an end-to-end reinforcement learning–driven curriculum system.

While accuracy is similar, curriculum trains faster, overfits less, and has better stability in early training phases.

The difficulty estimation architecture is reusable — it can be applied to other tasks, possibly with bigger payoff.

You're already seeing differentiation in training curves — possibly in longer training runs or with smaller models / harder datasets, the gap will widen.
